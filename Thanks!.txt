Hey guys, Zach here.

Thanks for letting me hang out and learn from you both.

I decided that I'm going to call it a day, but really appreciate both of your help picking
some of this stuff up. It was a good experience for me.

I'd like to see the finished product. I'll keep an eye out for it, and good luck!
